# FlaskAutoDocs

A simple package which adds autogenerated documentation page to your API service.

## How it works

Program received `Url`, `Methods` information from Flask object. And `Params`, `Description`, `Return` information from the function DocString.

### Params

Lines from DocString are interpreted  as `Params` if they matches next pattern:

`:api_param <param_name>: some description`

This will be parsed as `{<param_name>: 'some description'}`

###  Return
Here goes everything that follows `:return:` pattern in DocString.

### Descript
It takes a text from the beginning of the DocString till we met `:param` | `:api_param` | `:return` patterns

## How to use:

You need to add `@api_docs.doc` decorator to the function that should be documented. And to call `api_docs.html()` method to receive html page with results.

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_auto_docs import FlaskAutoDocs

app = Flask(__name__)
api_docs = FlaskAutoDocs(app)

@app.route('/person')
@api_docs.doc
def update_person():
    pass
    
@app.rout('/docs')
def docs():
    return @api_docs.html()
```

that will gave us next result:
![docs](docs/screen.png)
